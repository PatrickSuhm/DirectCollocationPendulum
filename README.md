# DirectCollocationPendulum

This repository contains the code for the following Youtube video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4Gy0nCv5gw
The code generates an optimal trajectory to transition from initial to final state and considers input and state constraints.
This theoretically works for an arbitrary dynamical system. The trajectory optimization is done with direct collocation in octave (using SQP)
